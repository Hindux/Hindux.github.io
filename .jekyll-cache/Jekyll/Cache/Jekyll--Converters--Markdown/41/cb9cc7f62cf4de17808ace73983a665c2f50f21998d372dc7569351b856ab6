<h4 id="what-is-termux-">What is termux ?</h4>
<p>Before going into deep, we should first and foremost know what exactly termux is, Termux is a very powerful linux terminal emulator which runs in android,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Termux is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app that works directly with no rooting or setup required. A minimal base system is installed automatically - additional packages are available using the APT package manager.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, termux is not just a simple terminal , it has own packages, it has above 1000+ packages, that‚Äôs why popularity are increasing day by day.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-different-from-standard-linux-">What is different from standard linux ?</h4>
<p>Offcourse it is different from linux in many aspects. As we know linux is OS but termux is just an android application which has to follow android restriction, in order to provide similar linux environment in android. It has all directory in $PREFIX , 
You may know if you have ever run linux  ,linux has /bin,/usr/ ,/share /etc all has in its root directory,but in unrooted device it‚Äôs impossible to write and execute program in android root directory , so termux has it‚Äôs own environment.</p>

<p>Here $PREFIX stands,for /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/</p>

<p>and all directory in $PREFIX,because any android app can read, write , execute in his /data/ partition</p>

<p>$PREFIX/bin
$PREFIX/etc
$PREFIX/share
$PREFIX/var</p>
